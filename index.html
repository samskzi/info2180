 <h2>Samara Soares</h2>
 <p>I am a second year Computer Science major, and I am so excited to be doing this web dev course as I have always been 
     interested in understanding just how the web works, and how people manage to create such captivating and creative websites. I also
     have been teaching myself web dev since quarantine, and I'm excited for the opportunity to learn more, and by extension, become a better web
     developer.</p>
